# Science and Computing with Raspberry Pi
## Brian R. Kent
Python and Mathematica code for the book Science and Computing with Raspberry Pi published
by IOP and Morgan and Claypool Publishers.

The world of single-board computing puts powerful coding tools in the palm of your hand.  The portable Raspberry Pi computing platform with the power of Linux yields an exciting exploratory tool for beginning scientific computing.

Science and Computing with Raspberry Pi takes the enterprising researcher, student, or hobbyist through explorations in a variety of computing exercises with the physical sciences.  The book has tutorials and exercises for a wide range of scientific computing problems while guiding the user through:

* Configuring your Raspberry Pi and Linux operating system
* Understanding the software requirements while using the Pi for scientific computing
* Computing exercises in physics, astronomy, chaos theory, and machine learning
